#First Release

# Introduction #

The FCSTools is releasing its first Tarball (actually a zip file)!


# Details #

This is the first release of the FCSTools utilities. The tarball contains the pertinent files from the SVN repository (which can be browsed elsewhere on the site). This tarball is of [revision 120](https://code.google.com/p/fcstools/source/detail?r=120) ([r120](https://code.google.com/p/fcstools/source/detail?r=120)) and is known to compile on Mac OS X 10.5.4 with GCC 4.3.0 . It is also known to compile on Linux.

There is no reason it should not compile on any reasonably compliant C++ compiler.

Included in this release are five utilities:
  * [fcsinfo](FCSInfo.md) _provides a brief summary and information about FCS2.0 and FCS3.0 files_
  * [fcsconvert](FCSConvert.md) _provides a number of utilities for manipulating FCS- 2.0 and 3.0 files_
  * [fcstest](FCSTest.md) _small test suite to make sure FCS- 2.0 and 3.0 files survive a round-trip_
  * [fcstofchr](FCS2FCHR.md) and [fchrtofcs](FCS2FCHR.md) _converts between FCS- 2.0 and 3.0 files and a human-readable format; [FCHR](FCHR.md) is a much easier to parse and use_
