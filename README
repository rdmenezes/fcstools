To compile you need a compiler & make utility. I would suggest the GNU toolset, as this is what I am compiling with. However, the code is standard enough that it should compile Damn Near Anywhere.

If you are building a project from this code, the code-base itself is flat and relative: keep all the code as it is, here, and it should compile just fine.

To compile:

make

Or:

make all -jX

Where `X' is one more than the number of processors and `all' means `all' projects. Optionally:

make Info

Builds just fcsinfo

make Convert

Builds just fcsconvert

make Test

Builds just fcstest (out-of-data)

make FCSxToHR

Builds fcstofchr and fchrtofcs

All of the source code is released under the GPL2, but the initial copyrights all are reserved to Jacob N. Smith. This code is used in internal projects; these projects are patent-encumbered, although this code is not; the code for those projects is closed-source and proprietary. Only those projects which I personally approve are allowed to use variants of the copyright which are not GPL2.
